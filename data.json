{"sightings":[{"text":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light. Was looking out my window and saw a orange colored, non blinking light floating across the night sky. Woke up my daughters to confirm what I was seeing. The object did not blink, was definitely not a helicopter. Very bright orange and moved slowly for about 2 minutes, disappeared behind the trees and did not see it again. Never seen anything like this in my life.","date":"01/10/2019","time":"10:00 PM","city":"Black Mountain","state":"NC","shape":"Fireball","duration":"2 minutes","summary":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light.

I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin","created_on":"Sat Feb 20 2021 15:57:23 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)"},{"hidden":"","city":"Singapore","state":"TestState value","date":"02/23/2022","time":"05:00 PM","shape":"Fireball","text":"Text value","summary":"Summary value","created_on":"Mon Feb 21 2022 14:45:37 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)"}],"visit_counter":64}
