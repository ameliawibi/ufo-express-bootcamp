{"sightings":[{"text":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light. Was looking out my window and saw a orange colored, non blinking light floating across the night sky. Woke up my daughters to confirm what I was seeing. The object did not blink, was definitely not a helicopter. Very bright orange and moved slowly for about 2 minutes, disappeared behind the trees and did not see it again. Never seen anything like this in my life.","date":"01/10/2019","time":"10:00 PM","city":"Black Mountain","state":"NC","shape":"Fireball","duration":"2 minutes","summary":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light.

I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin"},{"city":"City value test","state":"TestState value","date":"02/03/2022","time":"06:00 PM","shape":"Sphere","text":"tet","summary":"tet"},{"city":"1","state":"1","date":"02/02/2022","time":"06:00 PM","shape":"Sphere","text":"1","summary":"1"},{"city":"City value test","state":"test","date":"02/02/2022","time":"06:00 PM","shape":"Sphere","text":"q","summary":"q"},{"hidden":"","city":"City value test","state":"TestState value","date":"02/03/2022","time":"06:00 PM","shape":"Shape-shifting","text":"test","summary":"rer"},{"hidden":"","city":"sas","state":"asas","date":"02/03/2022","time":"06:00 PM","shape":"Fireball","text":"as","summary":"as"}]}
